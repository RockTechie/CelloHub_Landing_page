# CelloHub Landing page

A Landing page frontend webpage centered around the Cello Instrument, with added video and fully mobile responsive. 
As Kevin Powell says "help you fall in love with css a little bit more." 😂
This Landing Page creation is part of the coarse in Responsive Web Design Projects created by FreeCodeCamp.org. Enjoy 😁
